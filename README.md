#  Sign to Speak - Real-Time Sign Language Translator

##  Problem Statement
Millions of specially-abled people use sign language to communicate, but most people around them do not understand it. This creates a major barrier in daily interactions.

##  Objective
This project detects and translates **sign language gestures (A–Z, 0–9)** into **real-time text and speech**, bridging the communication gap between specially-abled and non-signing individuals.
